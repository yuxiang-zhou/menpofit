def compute_reference_shape(shapes, normalization_diagonal, target_shape=None, verbose=False):

    Function that computes the reference shape as the mean shape of the provided
    shapes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shapes : list of :map:`PointCloud`
        The set of shapes from which to build the reference shape.

    normalization_diagonal : `int`
        If int, it ensures that the mean shape is scaled so that the
        diagonal of the bounding box containing it matches the
        normalization_diagonal value.
        If None, the mean shape is not rescaled.

    verbose : `bool`, Optional
        Flag that controls information and progress printing.

    Returns
    -------
    reference_shape : :map:`PointCloud`
        The reference shape.

    r"""
    Function that normalizes the images sizes with respect to the reference
    shape (mean shape) scaling. This step is essential before building a
    deformable model.

    The normalization includes:
    1) Computation of the reference shape as the mean shape of the images'
       landmarks.
    2) Scaling of the reference shape using the normalization_diagonal.
    3) Rescaling of all the images so that their shape's scale is in
       correspondence with the reference shape's scale.

    Parameters
    ----------
    images : list of :class:`menpo.image.MaskedImage`
        The set of landmarked images to normalize.

    group : `str`
        The key of the landmark set that should be used. If None,
        and if there is only one set of landmarks, this set will be used.

    label : `str`
        The label of of the landmark manager that you wish to use. If no
        label is passed, the convex hull of all landmarks is used.

    normalization_diagonal: `int`
        If int, it ensures that the mean shape is scaled so that the
        diagonal of the bounding box containing it matches the
        normalization_diagonal value.
        If None, the mean shape is not rescaled.

        Note that, because the reference frame is computed from the mean
        landmarks, this kwarg also specifies the diagonal length of the
        reference frame (provided that features computation does not change
        the image size).

    verbose : `bool`, Optional
        Flag that controls information and progress printing.

    Returns
    -------
    reference_shape : :map:`PointCloud`
        The reference shape that was used to resize all training images to
        a consistent object size.
    normalized_images : :map:`MaskedImage` list
        A list with the normalized images.
